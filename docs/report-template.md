## GitHub Security Advisories

We recommend you create a private [GitHub Security Advisory](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory) for these findings. This also allows you to invite me to collaborate and further discuss these findings in private before they are [published](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/publishing-a-security-advisory). I will be happy to collaborate with you, and review your fix to make sure that all corner cases are covered. 
When you use a GitHub Security Advisory, you can request a CVE identification number from GitHub. GitHub usually reviews the request within 72 hours, and the CVE details will be published after you make your security advisory public. Publishing a GitHub Security Advisory and a CVE will help notify the downstream consumers of your project, so they can update to the fixed version.
