## V8 type confusion CVE-2024-5830

The analysis of this bug can be found [here](). 

The exploit here is tested on the official build of Chrome version 125.0.6422.112, on Ubuntu 22.04. The following build config was used to build Chromium:

```
is_debug = false
symbol_level = 1
blink_symbol_level = 1
dcheck_always_on = false
is_official_build = true
chrome_pgo_phase = 0
v8_symbol_level = 1
```

If successful, on Ubuntu 22.04, it should call launch `xcalc` when `calc.html` is opened in Chrome.

Shell code and some addresses may need changing on other platforms.
